We lived as a whole economy, travelling the breadth and depth of our territory; hunting, fishing, growing, harvesting, and trading created a sustainable economy that met our needs.\n\nToday the Similkameen People continue to assert their jurisdiction and responsibility over the stewarding of their land, resources, and quality of life of their citizens.

Sasquatch finally got the chipmunk and that is why the chipmunk also has stripes like the rocks.\n\nWhen all the animals got along chipmunk used to tease sasquatch all the time. One day chipmunk was teasing sasquatch, climbing all over him up and down, and he bit him. Sasquatch went blind with rage and anger at the chipmunk for biting him, he went to catch him but ended up scratching the chipmunk along his back, making him bleed. Sasquatch felt bad for scratching the chipmunk, seeing him hurt and bleeding he wanted to help, but the chipmunk was frightened from now.\n\nSasquatch chased the chipmunk all over the mountain sides trying to help, but the chipmunk was too fast for sasquatch and didn\u2019t want to be caught.  The Chipmunk was running and jumping all over the mountain sides in fear of being caught leaving his trails of blood O85as he got away.
