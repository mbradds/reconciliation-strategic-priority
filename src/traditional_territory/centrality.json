The main band offices are spread out over ten administration buildings in the Chase IR4 community.Adams Lake was once a gathering place where neighbors would come to meet, socialize and gather roots, berries and what the earth would provide for them. The shorelines of lakes and rivers have archaeological remains of pit-houses where the Secwepemc people resided in the surrounding premises that are old as nine thousand years\u2019 old.  We are often reminded by the Elders that our people have been here for centuries.  Our main source of economy was fishing, hunting, trapping and gathering berries which all led to developing networks, social and political systems.\n\nIn 1865 agent Douglas for the Crown agreed to setting out reserves for the community.  However, it was not until 1877, that the Joint Reserve Commission allotted seven reserves to our Band, totaling approximately 2,785 hectares.  These were not contiguous, which has always made it difficult to govern and manage the lands.  The seven reserves include: Cst\u00e8len IR #1 (Hustalen) located at the south end of Adams Lake as it outlets into the Adams River.  Sq7em IR #2 (Squaam) situated on the north shore of Squaam Bay, on the west side of Adams River.  Tegwups IR #3 (Toops) is positioned on the west shore of Adams Lake as it outlets into Adams River.

As a result of inhabiting the traditional territory for so long, many signs of our culture, such as artifacts, spiritual sites, stories, place names and traditions, remain tied to the land.  Much of the territory is presently used or held as fee simple land by First Nation community members, for uses such as farms, ranches, parks, mining activities, timber enterprises, oil and gas exploration and other uses related to transportation, among others.  The steady increase in all of those uses, with a gradual influx of more people has prevented us from accessing many of our traditional sites and has sometimes resulted in damaging or destroying significant cultural sites.  As a result, our young people have been discouraged from continuing traditional activities simply due to the realities of difficult access due to conflicting uses.  \n", "spread": "Spread 4 (KP 610 to 764)     ", "web": "https://www.adamslakeband.org", "map": "Secwepmc of the Secwepmc Nation", "srcTxt": "Aboriginal Engagement Website", "srcLnk": "http://iapps/AEWebsite/Maps/secwepemcdetailLarge.jpg\n", "pronounce": "", "dId": "secwepemc-secwepemcul-ewc"}, {"community": "Secwepmc (suh-Meh-much) of the Secwepmc Nation", "leadership": "Chief Shelly Loring, Councillors; Tina Donald, George Lampreau, Jules Philip, Ron Lampreau Jr., Alison Green, Martha Matthew", "contactPerson": "", "contactInfo": "Office: 250-828-9700", "protocol": "", "about": "The Secwepemc People, known by non natives as the Shuswap, are a Nation of 17 bands occupying the south central part of the Province of British Columbia, Canada.

The First Nation People lived in Pit House communities that were mostly used during the winter months, although some might have been used all year. A Pit House was a shelter built mostly below ground with an entrance and ladder at the top. Several families lived in a Pit House, as most were 8-10 meters in diameter. The First Nation People lived in Lean-to\u2019s as temporary shelters while travelling. Lean-to\u2019s were built to lean against a solid frame, and were intended to be very temporary. Nlaka\u2019pamux First Nations of the Fraser River made their living through seasonal hunting and gathering. They hunted animals such as deer, moose, elk, marmot, black bear and grouse and fished the rivers and creeks for salmon and trout. They also gathered berries, roots, vegetables, mushrooms, bark, and long roots (some for medical benefits). Salmon were prized above all other fish and were the economic, cultural and spiritual focus of First Nations in the Fraser River Basin. Nlaka\u2019pamux First Nations used many unique fishing tools such as weirs, basket traps, dip nets, gill nets and spears to catch sturgeon, trout and salmon.  Nlaka\u2019pamux basket-making is central to Nlaka\u2019pamux cultural identity, embodying women as culture bearers.

Rivers, valleys and mountain passes provided \u201chighways\u201d for our people to access the resources they needed to live a good and abundant life.

Summer villages were special places where family groups came together to socialize, attend to governance matters, and to share, trade and gather resources. These Nlaka\u2019pamux ancestors enjoyed a rich, complex cultural and spiritual life with teachings that structured social life and governance.  When European settlers arrived in Nlaka\u2019pamux territory in the first half of the 19th century, our ancestors willingly entered into economic relationships with these new neighbours, while incorporating the new technologies and occupations they brought with them into our lives.  By the mid-19th century, the newcomer population had grown exponentially, which in turn resulted in many changes to daily life in Nlaka\u2019pamux communities. Although our ancestors continued to engage in traditional activities on the land, accessing that land became more difficult as settlers put up fences and privatized large areas of our traditional territory.\nIn addition to continuing with their traditional activities, our ancestors adapted to this new way of life and the new rules and regulations about accessing lands and resources that were imposed by colonial governments.

They used the intricate network of waterways to travel from well-established winter villages to numerous seasonal camps situated on salmon streams, along ancient trading routes, and on far-flung outer islands. When Europeans arrived in the eighteenth century there were several Heiltsuk villages on the various islands near the present-day location of Bella Bella. In 1833 the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company established Fort McLoughlin, a heavily fortified fur trading post, on what is now McLoughlin Bay on Campbell Island. The Heiltsuk already had a well-established trading network on the coast, but the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company sought to supplant indigenous people as middlemen in the the fur trade wherever possible. Still, the officers at Fort McLoughlin found the Heiltsuk would not allow themselves to be pushed aside.\n\nDespite initial hostilities, within a few years a new Heiltsuk village was established in close proximity to Fort McLoughlin. The Heiltsuk became well known as skilled and savvy traders and developed a lucrative, if uneasy, business relationship with the fort. The Heiltsuk knew the village as \u2019Q\u00e9lc, but Europeans recorded various other names for the village, perhaps derived from the local geographical nameP\u00e9lb\u00e1la, that eventually gave rise to the modern English name Bella Bella. Members of Heiltsuk-speaking tribes from across the region who gradually relocated to the village over the next sixty years became known as the Bella Bella Indians. When Fort McLoughlin closed in 1843 the site was abandoned by Europeans. The village of \u2019Q\u00e9lc remained and the Heiltsuk continued to trade with the steamship-based trading system that replaced the fort.\n\nIn the winter of 1862-3 a devastating smallpox epidemic took a massive toll on the Heiltsuk population across our territory. Many villages were wiped out entirely, and most others didn\u2019t have enough people left to sustain them. Survivors from the various Heiltsuk tribes gradually amalgamated at Bella Bella, which is centrally located in Heiltsuk territory.\n\nIn 1866 European traders reoccupied the fort site at McLoughlin Bay and established a small store and a post office. Then, in 1880, Bella Bella (\u2019Q\u00e9lc) became the focus of Methodist mission work on the central coast. The villagers were encouraged to abandon their traditional bighouses and seasonal camps in favour of European-style houses. However, because most of the suitable building area on McLoughlin Bay was \u201cclaimed\u201d by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, there was a scarcity of land on which to build such houses. By the turn of the century most of the greatly diminished Heiltsuk population resided in Bella Bella (\u2019Q\u00e9lc), which had become crowded.\n\nIn 1897 the Heiltsuk, making the decision to move, surveyed a new town site three kilometres north of McLoughlin Bay. This place was known to the Heiltsuk as W\u00e1gl\u00edsla (meaning \u201criver on the beach\u201d). Building progressed quickly and by 1900 the people of \u2019Q\u00e9lc had relocated to the new village, which boasted large European-style houses and Heiltsuk-run businesses. This new community was called New Bella Bella.\n\nFor a time the prosperous new Heiltsuk village was a busy centre of trading and shipping activities on the coast. Within a decade the village was the second largest on the coast, with a hospital, school, sawmill, fire hall, wharf, warehouse, and planked roads with street lights. Residents contributed to, and shared in, the success of nearby ventures like Ocean Falls and Namu.\n\nIn 1914 a cannery was built on Denny Island. The store and post office at McLoughlin Bay were moved to the small town that grew around the cannery. Along with the post office went the name \u201cBella Bella\u201d, which was inherited by the new Denny Island settlement, giving rise to a confusion of names that persists today.\n\nAs the century progressed, diminishing resources and the decreasing dependence of industry on remote communities caused New Bella Bella\u2019s existence to become more isolated and precarious. Ocean Falls and Namu eventually became ghost towns and the cannery on Denny Island fell into ruin. The community on Denny Island relocated to nearby Kliktsoatli Harbour, where an airstrip was built in WWII, becoming Shearwater.\n\nBut New Bella Bella (Waglisla) was revitalized by the building of an airport and BC Ferries terminal and continued to grow and prosper. Today this vital, contemporary community is simply called Bella Bella.\n\nToday the \u2019Q\u00e9lc village site, all but disappeared, is known as Old Bella Bella or Old Town.

Long before the emergence of any other human community in the lower Fraser region, the Creator placed five communities, each with its own chief, at different locations on the land. Those locations are now known as Pitt lake, Sheridan Hill, Port Hammond, Point Roberts and Point Grey. The Katzie people are the direct descendants of these first people; the people that came to be known as the Katzie people descend primarily from Oe'lecten and his people, created at the south shore of Pitt Lake, and Swaneset and his people, created at Sheridan Hill.\n\nDuring these first days after the arrival of human beings, there were few trees, and although there were clams and mussels in the rivers and along the seashore, there was no wind and there were no birds, land animals, sturgeon, salmon, oolichan or sea lions. But the Creator gave these first five leaders gifts and powers to bequeath to those that followed after them. When he placed Swaneset on the earth, the Creator provided the sun and the moon. For Oe'lecten, the Creator provided the seasons and the rainbow.\n\nOe'lecten was then granted a wife, and their children became the sturgeon and a white bird that can only be seen by Oe'lecten's descendants. Oe'lecten's people first settled in villages at Fox Creek, Widgeon Creek at the southwest corner of Pitt Lake, a village occupied until recently, presently known as Katzie I.R. 4.\n\nSwaneset, honouring the Creator's instructions to finish making the territory surrounding the place he had been set down on earth, reshaped the land in order to make it abundant in berry and root crops. Standing on the peak of Sheridan Hill, which was once the highest mountain in the territory, Swaneset called on the help of the Creator, and made Sturgeon Slough and its tributaries. He then made the Alouette River and other sloughs, including Katzie Slough. Swaneset then named all these waterways, and named the river now known as the Fraser. After a time, Swaneset travelled to the sky, and returned to earth with a wife, setting down again on the peak of Sheridan Hill. From the pieces of Sheridan Hill, Swaneset created many of the distinctive hills that mark the countryside between the Fraser River and Pitt Lake. When Swaneset had finished reshaping the land to make it more abundant for his people, he then instructed all his people to gather at Katzie to make homes for themselves here, in the vicinity of the present Pitt Meadows reserve. There, on the banks of the Fraser River, his sky-born wife opened her dowry box, and ushered oolichan and seagulls into this world, and she taught the people how to catch the fish and prepare them. for additional info.    eire.ca/history/heritage/hist1.html", "spread": "Spread 6 (KP 1075.1 to 1144.480)", "web": "", "map": "Katzie First Nation", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/katzie_fcrsa_renewal_2-years_term_executed_sep_15_2020.pdf", "pronounce": "KUT-zee", "dId": "katzie"}]}, "Kwantlen First Nation": {"loc": [49.476845, -122.296959], "info": [{"community": "Kwantlen First Nation (tireless Runner)", "leadership": "Chief Marilyn Gabriel (November 30, 1993) Councillors; Leslie Antone, Tumia Knott", "contactPerson": "Economic Development contact: Brenda Fernie, VP, Seyem Qwantlen Business Group (604) 888-5556 info@seyemqwantlen.ca", "contactInfo": "Office: (604) 888-2488   Tumia Knott, Lands, Resources and stewardship", "protocol": "Ashley Doyle - Land and Resource Manager  ashley@kwantlenlands.ca", "about": "Since time immemorial, we live by the seven traditional laws that guided our ancestors: health, happiness, generations, generosity, humbleness, forgiveness and understanding.

The Similkameen People were originally a nomadic people that moved from location to location, mainly due to the ever changing availability of foods and climates. There were certain criteria that had to be met, for an encampment or village site to be located. The potential areas had to have Look-Out Points, Nearby Food and Water Sources, Wood Availability, and Hunting Grounds .\nThe original Native Encampment in the Keremeos area was located where Bear\u2019s Fruit Stand now presides.\n\nThe population of this encampment has been estimated to be between 800 \u2013 1000 people.  This encampment had a good water supply, had good look-out points, and was easily defended.  There was another encampment located nearby, at what is now the Rocking Chair Ranch.  This encampment had an estimated 500 people living there.  They had a fresh-water spring, that provided an excellent source of water.  Also at this location, was a plentiful supply of reeds and tulies.\n\nBefore and upon Contact with Non-Natives, the Dwellings that the Similkameen people stayed in consisted of Pit Houses, Tulie Shelters, Ntamlken Lodges, and Winter Kickwillies.  Pit Houses were made of wood and hemp.  Tulie Shelters were made of reeds, wood and hemp.  Ntamlken Lodges were made with reeds, wood and hemp rope.  Summer Lodges were made of poles and fir boughs.  Winter Kickwillies were made of poles, grass, bark, tulies, and skins of animals.\n\nOriginally, the Similkameen people had a social structure which was governed by a line of Hereditary Chiefs within the greater community.  Each village was led by a Chief that cared for the particular needs of that village.  Advisors known as Wise/Good Men and Women assisted the Chiefs with the difficult decisions that had to be made.\n\nPrior to Contact with Non-Natives, the Similkameen people would gather seasonally to trade goods with Neighbouring Tribes.  Depending on which season it was, the locations would vary.  At these different sites, thenumber of people that gathered to trade could number anywhere from 2000 \u2013 5000 people.  At these trading sites, sometimes the different tribes would compete in games as a form of social gathering and also to demonstrate their strength as a people.\n\nThe coming of Non-Natives to the Similkameen can be mainly attributed to the expansion of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Trading Company, not to mention Missionaries that were sent to live amongst the native population.

The Lakes Secwepemc inhabits the eastern most part the Secwepemc Territory in and around the South Thompson River and the large Shuswap, Adams and Mara Lakes.  Traditionally this complex of waterways played a large role in the Lakes Secwepemc travel patterns.\n\nLake Division Secwepemc Winter villages were almost exclusively on the River Terraces on dry, well-drained sites near major streams and along lakes within the Lakes Division territories with good south exposure and shelter from the valley winds. Villages were often near an important fishery, so there were many small villages of a few families scattered up and down the main rivers and along major lakes.  Pit houses were the preferred c7\u2019Istkten (winter homes), but there were other styles of insulated houses as well.\n\nThe Lakes Secwepemc delayed their move into the village as long as good weather held, but usually they were settled in by November. Early in winter, the villages were used as a basecamp for hunting and fishing expeditions while the houses were readied for the swucwt (snow) season.  Ts\u2019i7 (deer), Ten\u2019Iye (moose) and SweIaps (sheep) moved down from the mountains in their autumn prime and closer to the villages. These important food animals were in their rut in November, and easy to bait and call. The rivers were the source of sqlelten (salmon), a staple in Secwepemc diet, economy and culture. Whenever salmon were in our rivers, our people harvested sqlelten using various methods. Even in early spring and early winter a few people would be camped near the salmon rivers, eating fresh sqlelten.  By mid-summer, the main sqlelten runs were underway and most people were camped at the riverside fishing stations.  A frenzied month of fishing, processing, camp maintenance, and transportation to the winter village gradually ended as the fishery tapered off. The fishing basecamps were the centre of feasting, marriage, ceremony, and dancing. Important fishing camps were also the point of trade between neighboring villages and nations. Major bartering ceremonies in the region attracted over 1,000 participants.\n\nLate in the sqlelten season, men made snowshoes, nets, rope and other winter gear or searched for the fine-grained rock, especially black basalt to make adzes and other tools. Women completed processing and storing the catch.  The River Valley was hunted for Ts\u2019i7 and other ungulates seeking winter protection in the riverside forests, but only on mild days because the animals were lean. In deep S7istk (winter) our people stayed in the village and lived on food stored during spring, summer and fall foraging trips.  On warmer days, a few individuals and small parties might try pixem (hunting) for Ts\u2019i7 in nearby grasslands or ice fishing or hare and grouse snaring near a forest margin.\n\nThe Lakes Secwepemc left their c7\u2019Istkten\u2019s as soon as weather allowed, usually in February when melting snows and longer days made hunting easier, and even a few early plants were sprouting. The River Terraces near the villages were also habitat for many plants the Secwepemc used for food.  Spring was also the time to collect materials for making the basic tools of Secwepemc technology -bows, arrows, containers, tool handles, rope, and cordage, made from sap-filled willow, mock orange, juniper birch, maple, cottonwood, Saskatoon, and bitter cherry.", "spread": "Thompson Country Spread 4 (KP 610 to 764) ", "web": "https://neskonlith.net/", "map": "Neskonlith Indian Band", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/forestry-agreements/neskonlith_ftoa_19dec12.pdf", "pronounce": "Nes-con-lith", "dId": ""}]}, "Nooaitch Indian Band": {"loc": [49.690318, -120.648292], "info": [{"community": "Nooaitch Indian Band", "leadership": "Chief Marcel Shackkelly", "contactPerson": "Larry Jordan, Band Administator (250) 378-6141", "contactInfo": "(250) 378-6141 reception@nooaitch.com   ljordan@nooaitch.com", "protocol": "David Lawrence Bosnich - Lands Manager david@nooaitchband.ca", "about": "The Nooaitch Indian Band is one of the member\u2019s bands of the Nicola Valley Tribal Nation.

If you look for the name Diitiida on a map today, you won't find it, since most of the Pacheedaht names for places have been replaced by English place names. The river the Pacheedaht call Diitiida is marked as \"Jordan River\" on modern maps.\n\n The Ditidaht First Nation get their name from the village shared at Jordan River. Ditidaht means \"People of Diitiida,\" or people of Jordan River. During the great flood, some of the people living at Diitiida managed to survive by fleeing in a canoe that they anchored to the top of a high mountain in order to escape the rising waters. Afterwards some of the survivors settled at Whyac village at the outlet of Nitinat Lake into the Pacific Ocean, and became the ancestors of the people who today form the Ditidaht First Nation.\n\nOthers amongst the flood survivors returned to the village at Diitiida (Jordan River) and settled once again in their home territory. Eventually this branch of the people from Diitiida became centred on a village at the head of Port San Juan at the mouth of the San Juan River, called p'a:chi:da. This is also the native name for the San Juan River. Before the diseases came to our territory, brought by white explorers, traders and settlers, some estimates say that the Pacheedaht numbered 1,500 people or more. Pacheedaht ancestors followed a seasonal round that included moving residence to several places throughout an average year in order to take advantage of seasonally abundant resources.

The Saanich Nation belongs to a broader cultural group known as Central Coast Salish.  Saanich First Nation settlements have been mostly concentrated on the western side of the Saanich Peninsula.  the population in Pauquachin began as a small group of 14 families and many of these families are still present today.\n\n Historically, Pauquachin\u2019s economic life has been based on salt-water adaptation due to the community\u2019s position on the Saanich Peninsula.  Saanich people developed a reef-netting technology to gather their food, which was unique to their cultural area.  Fishing and hunting sites were organized into areas that were \u201cowned\u201d by certain families and ares that were \u201copen\u201d to everyone.  historians found that the majority of sites were open resource areas. The material culture and residential pattern of the Saanich people were oriented around the seasonal availability of ocean foods within their traditional lands.  Some historians believe that Point Roberts was the summer fishery for the Saanich people while Goldstream was the winter fishery.\n\n According to historical records, traditional Saanich housing comprised of 100 foot long cedar longhouses and they would house multiple families.  In 1932, artist Arthur Pitts created a painting of a 100 foot cedar longhouse on the Pauquachin reserve, which he referred to as \u201cLlalam\u201d.  \u201cLlalam\u201d may be a variation of the Hul\u2019qumi\u2019num word for home, \u201clelum\u201d.  Cedar trees were an important resource for the Saanich people, as both their longhouses and dugout canoes were made from cedar.

A reserve for the \u201cLangley Indians\u201d (Kwantlen First Nation) nd Musqueam (Musqueam I.R. #1) was established directly on top of the fishing village of qiq\u00e9yt. In 1879, the federal government allocated three reserves as general reserves for \u201cAll Coastal Indians.\u201d These reserves were established inclusive of 104 acres (0.42 km2) of the South Westminster Reserve, 22 acres (89,000 m2) on the North Arm of the Fraser River and 27 acres (110,000 m2) on Poplar Island.[2] These carry the Musqueam names of yel\u0259\u026ck\u02b7\u0259, sk\u02b7tex\u02b7q\u0259n, and w\u0259\u0301q\u0313\u02b7a\u03c7\u0259n s\u03c7\u02b7ay\u0259m\u0259\u026c.\n\nOn September 4, 1913 George Roberts \u201cof the New Westminster Band of Indians\u201d met with commissioners of the British Columbia, Royal Commission on Indian Affairs. In his interview Roberts acknowledged Musqueam as chief of the \u201cNew Westminster\u201d Indians and many Musqueam continued to use the site seasonally through the 1930s and 40s for fishing.[3] Musqueam continued to live at qiq\u00e9yt into the 1930s. In 1959 this reserve was sold to pay for a water systems on Musqueam's I.R. #2. qiq\u00e9yt continues to be important to Musqueam and they continue to fish in the waters around this important village site.  In Musqueam issued their Declaration which states Musqueam\u2019s rights and title to their unceded traditional territory and countersigned by the community at the time. qiq\u00e9yt is site #32.\n\nKwantlen First Nation recognizes qiqeyt as a very significant part of their unceded traditional territory. Many Kwantlen families trace their direct lineage from qiqeyt Village in South Westminster (now Lehigh Hanson Concrete Batch Plant).\n\nThe Aboriginal Gathering Place at the New Westminster campus of Douglas College was built in partnership with the Qayqayt First Nation. This Gathering Place contains a large mural depicting and celebrating the Band and its people.  Wikipedia        In the 19th century, a village alongside of what is now Front Street in New Westminster was called Qayqayt (pronounced Ka-kite). In 1859, New Westminster City Council sought to remove the First Peoples from the city core, creating three reserves in the surrounding area, including 27 acres of Poplar Island and 105 acres across the Fraser River at Bridgeview.   A smallpox epidemic killed many First Peoples in 1904; in 1916, the McKenna McBride Commission closed the New Westminster Indian Reserve and told the residents to move. Many reserves in British Columbia were being closed at this time, most without compensation or alternative lands to help them move. Qayqayt from New Westminster were married into or adopted into other Nations, relocating to Musqueam, Squamish, and Washington State. The story of the Qayqayt was almost forgotten.  Chief Larrabee\u2019s mother, aunt and uncle were the last few living members of the Qayqayt First Nation, which once numbered 400 people before their lands were sold and their remaining reserve was deemed inactive in 1951. Chief Larrabee\u2019s journey of self-discovery led her to apply for Indian Status in 1994, resurrect the Qayqayt Band, become chief, and work to keep the legacy of her ancestors alive through education.

We were, in the past, and continue today to be the caretakers of the land and resources for our future generations. When the world was not right, during the times of our origins, the people could transform back and forth into sturgeon. We consider ourselves Sqw\u014dwich, People of the Sturgeon. Our special relationship with the land and resources comes from the time of the transformers, the Xex\u00e1:ls who taught us how to live right and relate to the living world in a good way.   In the old times, there were three main extended family groups in our Sq\u2019\u00e9wlets community. As in other Coast Salish tribes, the leaders of these families carried prestigious names. These names were passed down through the generations, and still are today. Often, one family had a respected leader who was called the \u201cYewal Siy\u00e1:m\u201d or \u201cfirst going chief.\u201d Our families owned and managed many types of resources--such as salmon fishing sites, fish traps and weirs, upland berry patches, wetlands growing basketry plants, islands where female dogs were kept while in heat, and hunting territories. High status Sq\u2019\u00e9wlets people arranged for their sons and daughters to marry into other communities. This meant that Scowlitz people had strong ties to people from other St\u00f3:l\u014d villages. These marriages brought access to many types of food resources and created peace with our relations. High status men often had several wives from different communities.  In European society of the same time, most people were peasants or working class. Many of our people, however, were high status smel\u00e1:lh, or \u201cworthy people\u201d. A smaller number of people were like commoners. Beneath the commoners were two other groups. The first were known as s\u2019t\u00e9xem, or \u201cworthless people\u201d who had \u201clost or forgotten\u201d their history. The lowest status people were skw\u2019iyeth, slaves who were either captured in raids as children, bought, or the children of slaves.  This is how our society was before the Xwel\u00edtem (\u201cHungry People\u201d; European settlers; newcomers without land or resource rights) came in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Archaeological surveys have found winter sites and food cache pits throughout the region, including finds in Finn Creek, Vavenby, Birch Island, Clearwater, Little Fort, Chu Chua, Barriere, Louis Creek, T\u00eate Jeune, and Jasper.  Traditionally, the Simpcw people were known for their hunting abilities; much of the Simpcw culture centres on the gathering of local plants and animals for survival. In the summer months, hunting camps were established above the North Thompson and upper Fraser Rivers, where Simpcw people caught fish, primarily salmon, with nets, spears and weirs. They also hunted wildlife that lived in the forests and fields, and smoked or dried the meat for storage, so they would have food for the winter months. Plant collection was common; food, medicines and technology were common uses for the vegetation they collected.   Simpcw people often interacted with other First Nations bands that lived nearby, as well. They actively traded with other Secwepemc bands, as well as other Nations throughout the area. Sometimes, they fought with other Nations from BC and Alberta, usually over natural resources and land.

These were the \u201cGood People\u201d who sat in on decisions and brought them back to their families. Today, they are referred to as Councillors. They represent their family and make decisions on behalf of the community. These individuals are selected in the same way as Kukpi7. They are personable, have recognized skills and knowledge and are advisors on all community matters. A Kukpi7 cannot works without ensuring that the interests of the people are considered and their success is linked to the Councillors.At a point of history, the Bonaparte Indian Band selected their leaders in a traditional manner until August 6, 1952, where under Order in Council PC 3692, stated that Chief and Council were to abide by elections under s.74 of the Indian Act. While this may prove to prevent Stuctwewsemc from continuing to practice their traditions, it is clear that the notion of family has continued and will continue to be integral for the future.  In Stuctwewsemc, the roles and responsibilities of the Chiefs and Councillors have seen much change in 74 years. It has not made the positions easier, in fact, if anything, the environment has added to the work. With the establishment of the Band Office in the 1970s, the Chief and Council, rather than the Indian Agent, preside over concerns within the community and also must deal with outside Government, Agencies, and Corporations. It is not just matters within the community.

The other Dakelh communities are Lhoosk\u2019us Dene, Nazko, and Lhtalo Dene (formerly Red Bluff). In earlier times before British Columbia became colonized by Euro-Canadians, Ulkatcho Village was an important potlatching and trading centre at the junction of many trading trails heading north to Chezlatta, east to the Fraser River, west to the Central Coast, and north to the Chilcotin Plateau. The village consisted of a potlatch house and several temporary brush shelters on the shore of Gatcho Lake about 80 kilometres north of Anahim Lake. There were similar potlatch houses in other parts of Ulkatcho territory. Mac Squinas said his grandfather Captain Harry Alexie told him about a potlatch house at Qualcho Lake, west of Ulkatcho Village. Theresa Holte said her elders told her about the potlatch at Nagwuntl\u2019oo in Anahim Lake. These potlatch houses were important gathering sites for Ulkatcho people to come together to celebrate and trade.\n\nMost of the year Ulkatcho people lived in extended family groups isolated from each other as they moved about the country hunting and fishing and gathering the food and materials they needed for survival. Each family had its own fishing, hunting and trapping areas and winter quarters, usually near a lake abundant with fish. There were also a number of gathering sites throughout the territory where people came from of their remote family homes to work together to hunt, fish and preserve food for the winter. Ulkatcho families were extremely mobile and had the ability to pick up and move hundreds of kilometres across the country on very short notice when it was time to harvest the resources at a particular location. Throughout the year a family might travel from the Fraser River to the Central Coast, and from Chezlatta to the Potato Mountains in Ts\u0302ilhqot\u2019in territory.\n\nIn the Dakelh language, Ulkatcho means \u201cfat of the land\u201d. This name came about because Gatcho Lake and nearby lakes were full of fish and the surrounding area was rich in game and fur bearing animals. The elders say one of the important reasons people came together at Ulkatcho Village was to hunt caribou. A large group of people was needed for the success of the hunt. They worked together to build drift fences and herd the animals into a place where they could be killed and the meat cut up. The late Chief Jimmy Stillas said all the animals in a small herd would be killed and the meat shared among the whole community.\n\nTanya Lakes, known as Taintezli or Tanyez Tezdli in the Ulkatcho dialect, was another important gathering site along the Nuxalk-Dakelh Grease Trail west of Ulkatcho Village. The large camping grounds west of Tanya Lakes known as Taintezli (where the slow water of the lake becomes the fast water of the creek) was at the fork of the grease trails to Kimsquit and Bella Coola Valley. One fork followed Takia Creek to the Dean River, Salmon House Falls and Kimsquit, and the other trail went over the Rainbow Mountains to Bella Coola. Tanya Lakes and Salmon House Falls were important salmon fishing sites in Ulkatcho territory. When the spring salmon and steelhead arrived in Takia Creek to spawn at Taintezli in August, many Ulkatcho families along with their Dakelh, Nuxalk and Tsilhqot\u2019in neighbours camped there to catch and dry the fish. Several families had smokehouses at Taintesli. There were other smokehouses further down Takia Creek closer to where the big spring salmon were caught in the river, and smokehouses at Salmon House Falls on the Dean River. These gatherings like the one at Taintesli were important social times. Traditional games like lahal and other competitions like running races, horseback races, wrestling matches, spear-throwing and shooting contests were held. Lahal was a serious gambling game and Chief Jimmy Stillas said sometimes a person lost their horse in a lahal game and had to walk home.\n\nUlkatcho people have family ties with neighbouring Dakelh communities of Chezlatta, Lhoosk\u2019us Dene, Lhtalo Dene (Red Bluff) and Nazko. Also a significant number of Ulkatcho families are related to the Ts\u0302ilhqot\u2019in and Nuxalk as well. One of the names given to the the Ulkatchot\u2019en by their Dakelh neighbours was Nechowt\u2019en which means \u201cDakelh people mixed with Ts\u0302ilhqot\u2019in\u201d. O82Famous Nuxalk game guide and grizzly bear hunter Clayton Mack, whose first wife, Cecelia \u201cDoll\u201d Capoose, was an Ulkatcho woman from Abuntlet, once described Anahim Lake as the place where Indigenous people from different backgrounds \u201cmixed and lived\u201d.

The 1862-63 smallpox epidemic decimated WFN\u2019s population by two-thirds. James Teit estimated WLFN\u2019s population at 100 members in 1909. As of April 2021, our membership has recovered to 857 band members with 235 members currently living on reserve and 578 living off reserve and 43 living in other First Nations Communities.\n\nWLFN is a thriving Secwepemc community. The Nation\u2019s mandate and mission is to become a healthy and prosperous community and continue to develop effective governance. While in stage 5 of the BCTC Treaty Process, WLFN is in the process of transitioning away from the Indian Act. Since 1991, WLFN has developed its own Membership Code (1991), Custom Election Code (2007). WLFN is presently governed by the WLFN Land Management Code (2016) and the WLFN Financial Administration Law (2018). WLFN has been International Standard Organization (ISO) certified since 2008.\n\nSince the mid 1990s WLFN has been an economic opportunity driver in the Central Cariboo, the main enterprises owned and operated by WLFN include UNITY Cannabis, Sugar Cane Cannabis, Sugar Cane Petroleum Products, Sugar Cane Archeology, Chief Will-yum Campsite, Coyote Rock Real Estate Development, Coyote Rock Golf Course, and Borland Creek Logging. These enterprises do not only serve WLFN\u2019s on and off-reserve members but the general public and tourists passing through our community.", "spread": "", "web": "https://williamslakeband.ca/", "map": "Williams Lake Indian Band", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/williams_lake_ib_fcrsa_executed_jan_112017.pdf", "pronounce": "", "dId": ""}]}, "Yale First Nation": {"loc": [49.492718, -121.423097], "info": [{"community": "Yale First Nation ", "leadership": "Chief Ken Hansen (Next election: September 6, 2023)", "contactPerson": "Chief Ken Hansen khansen@yalefirstnation.ca\n", "contactInfo": "Phone: 604-869-0013         Box 1869, Hope, BC  ", "protocol": "Steve Patterson - Lands/Resources and Economic Development spatterson@yalefirstnation.ca", "about": "Yale First Nation (YFN) is a small progressive First Nation Community situated on the #7 and #1 Highways. YFN territory begins in the Fraser Valley and runs along the Fraser River to the beginning of the Fraser Canyon. Geographically it starts 18 km from downtown Agassiz, and occurs sporadically along the highways until you reach Yale BC 33 km later. It consists of sixteen parcels of reserve land, four of which are distinct and separate residential communities which are currently occupied by fifty nine (59) of the total 176 registered community members, and the remaining twelve consist of many kilometres of uninhabitable rocky-river front, mountain side and privately owned commercial ventures.\n\nIn 2013 the community elected a new Chief and leadership team after 30 years. The transition from old to new required a physical move taking the administration off reserve and into the community of Hope situated approximately midway between the residential communities identifying a central location on which to establish a government office. \n\nAccording to the INAC website there are no population statistics available for YFN prior to 2011. The 2011 statistics state that there were a total population of 90.  60 of whom were registered Indians, and that the median age was 49.5 years of age.  Our current membership list ( 2017)  identifies 166 members; 65 living on reserve and 101 living off. 35% of the population is between ages 25 and 50, and 23% are over 50. This aging population and lack of births indicates the challenges that are coming for YFN in health and supportive care; No youth to take up the care of the elders, no youth to bring economic stability to the community, no youth to lead the community through the coming years. Without the influx of children and youth the community elders have no one to pass along the stories and history, and without the ability to pass along the traditional knowledge the community suffers from uncertainty regarding the future and our capacity to retain our culture and traditional knowledge.", "spread": "Spread 5 (KP 806 to 1075)", "web": "https://www.yalefirstnation.ca/", "map": "Yale First Nation", "srcTxt": "", "srcLnk": "", "pronounce": "", "dId": ""}]}, "Xat'sull First Nation (Soda Creek)": {"loc": [52.854978, -121.585666], "info": [{"community": "Xat'sull First Nation (Soda Creek)", "leadership": "Chief Sherri Sellars - term every 4 yrs, next election March 25, 2023\nCouncil Kelly Sellars\nCouncil Crystal Harry\nCouncil Mike Stinson\nCouncil Marni Sellars", "contactPerson": "Howard Campbell - Interim CEO howard.campbell@xatsulldevelopment.com", "contactInfo": "Office: (250) 989-2323                 3405 Mountain House Road, Williams Lake BC", "protocol": "office: ((250) 989-2323  ", "about": "Xat\u015b\u016bll First Nation is an Indigenous community located on the edge of the Fraser River just north of Williams Lake, British Columbia. Xat\u015b\u016bll First Nation consists of over 400 members who are a part of a larger group of British Columbia\u2019s Interior Salish people known as the Secwepemc. The Interior Salish occupy the south central region of the Province and are comprised of four separate nations known as the St\u2019at\u2019imc (Lillooet), Nlaka\u2019pamux (Thompson), Siylx (Okanagan) and Secwepemc (Shuswap). The Secwepemc Nation is the largest and northernmost Interior Salish group. They have occupied the region for thousands of years prior to European settlement. The vast traditional territory of the Secwepemc people extended from the Rocky Mountains in the East through the Columbia River valley to the west of the Fraser River area and the Southern Arrow Lakes region to the Northern McBride area. The Secwepemc Nation was traditionally a self-governing people who were united by Secwepemctsin language, culture and belief system; however the bands were operated separate and independent from each other. Yet the nation worked together as a political alliance that regulated use of the land and resources, and protected their territories. The Xat\u015b\u016bll First Nation is the most northerly Secwepemc community in this vast region and has occupied this village site for at least 5,000 years. For thousands of years the Northern Secwepemc have occupied and utilized large areas of the northern territory extending East of Mt. Alex Graham going North East to Bowen Lake areas including areas around Quesnel Lake and Horsefly.\n ", "spread": "Spread 4 (KP 610 to 764)     ", "web": "http://xatsull.com/", "map": "Xat'sull First Nation (Soda Creek)", "srcTxt": "BC Forestry Agreement Website", "srcLnk": "https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/consulting-with-first-nations/agreements/xatsull_fcrsa_finalized_june_11_2019.pdf", "pronounce": "", "dId": ""}]}}
